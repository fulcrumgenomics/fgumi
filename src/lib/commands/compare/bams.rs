//! Compare two BAM files for equality of core SAM fields and tag values.
//!
//! Tags are compared by value regardless of their order in the record.
//! This is useful for verifying that two BAM files are functionally equivalent
//! even if they were produced by different tools.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! This module is optimized for large BAM files with:
//! - Multi-threaded BGZF decompression (`--threads`)
//! - Batch processing with double buffering
//! - Lazy tag comparison (avoids allocations when tags match)
//! - Zero-copy field comparisons where possible
//! - Fast hashing with ahash

Compare two BAM files for equality of core SAM fields and tag values.

This tool compares BAM files record-by-record, checking:
- Core SAM fields: QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, POS, MAPQ, CIGAR, RNEXT, PNEXT, TLEN, SEQ, QUAL
- Tag values (order-independent comparison)

Tags are compared by value only - the order of tags within a record does not matter.
This allows comparing BAM files produced by different tools that may serialize tags
in different orders.

MODES:

  content (default):
    Pure record-by-record comparison of all fields and tags. Records are
    paired by their RecordKey identity, so a difference in record order is
    reported honestly as a difference rather than silently masked (the sound
    default). Does not analyze MI groupings - just compares raw content.

  grouping:
    For comparing grouped BAM files where MI assignment order may differ. A
    streaming molecule-join: both inputs must already be grouped (same-MI
    reads consecutive, as fgumi group/fgbio group output is) since this mode
    never re-sorts either input. Molecules are matched across the two files
    by an MI-invariant canonical id (so --ignore-order is a no-op here,
    retained only for backward compatibility). Every matched pair is checked
    for record membership, non-MI content (EXACT-MI: every field except the
    MI tag, so a non-MI content difference DIFFERs even when the MI grouping
    itself is untouched), and duplex /A//B strand-partition equivalence.

COMMAND PRESETS (--command):

  Use `--command <stage>` to apply canonical `--mode` and `--ignore-order`
  defaults for comparing output from a specific fgumi pipeline stage. This is
  especially useful for cross-tool comparisons (e.g. fgumi vs. fgbio) where
  MI values or record order may legitimately differ. Explicit `--mode` or
  `--ignore-order` flags override the preset.

  Command         --mode      --ignore-order   Notes
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  extract         content     false            No MI tags; deterministic
  zipper          content     false            Preserves MI tags unchanged
  sort            (dedicated sort-verify engine; --mode/--ignore-order rejected)
  correct         content     false            Modifies RX tag only, not MI
  dedup           content     false            Deterministic
  filter          content     false            Passes through MI/depth tags unchanged; exact (like consensus)
  group           grouping    true             Molecule-join: EXACT-MI content + membership/strand (cross-tool)
  simplex         content     false            Exact (cD/cM/cE compared exactly; clamped at source)
  duplex          content     false            Exact (cD/cM/cE + aD/aM/bD/bM/aE/bE, exact)
  codec           content     false            Exact (same as simplex/duplex)

  `sort` verifies order instead of comparing content positionally: it detects the
  shared sort order from both inputs' @HD header, checks each file is itself
  correctly ordered, and compares the two files as a multiset grouped by maximal
  equal-core-sort-key run — tolerating intra-run tie reordering (coordinate ties,
  and fgumi's template-coordinate name-hash-vs-lexical tie residue) while still
  catching a mis-sort, a missing/extra record, or any content difference.

  Examples:

    # Preset equivalents of the above:
    fgumi compare bams --command extract a.bam b.bam
    fgumi compare bams --command sort     a.bam b.bam
    fgumi compare bams --command group    a.bam b.bam
    fgumi compare bams --command simplex  a.bam b.bam

    # Preset + explicit override (e.g. same-tool group comparison via content):
    fgumi compare bams --command group --mode content a.bam b.bam

Example usage:
  fgumi compare bams bam1.bam bam2.bam                    # content mode (default)
  fgumi compare bams bam1.bam bam2.bam --mode content    # content (explicit)
